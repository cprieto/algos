\maketitle

In this personal notes I will be discussing the algorithms we saw in the last semester, I will implement the same algorithm in a few different languages to practice, I did all the samples so far in Python, but I am thinking in rewrite those samples in things like Go or Elixir to practice.

I am doing this as a way to remember the subject that I neglected the most during my last semester (and paradoxically, the subject I did better, Matty\footnote{That's how we called our Algorithms professor, Dr. Matty Hobban} didn't deserve that).

\subsection*{Above the source code}

I love using Python type hinting, so for most of the examples I will assume the following imports are present:

\begin{minted}{python}
from typing import TypeVar, List
T = TypeVar('T')
\end{minted}

I wrote the samples (and unit tests for the samples) in the same repository for this document, if you want to check them out take a look at my GitHub repository.

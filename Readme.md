# Algorithms

In the last semester we were covering algorithms, to be honest, I didn't put too much attention to the class so while holidays I decided to go through all of them and cover them in a document.

I will be writing some notes about the algorithm here as well and writing the code of the algorithm in Python, Go, C and a functional language (Elixir or maybe Elm). I am doing this as a refresher, so don't expect something too advance!

## Sorting algorithms

### Bubble sort

### Selection sort
